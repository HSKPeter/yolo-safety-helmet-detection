# YOLO Safety Helmet Detection

## Development Guide
- Run `make setup` to setup the development environment, and follow the instructions to setup datasets
- Run `make yolo` to run a demo of the YOLOv5 model, which will retrain the yolov5 model and make prediction for the [bus.jpg](./src/assets/img/bus.jpg) like the following

- Run `make predict-img` to run a demo of the YOLOv5 model on a image, which will make prediction on the [helmet.jpg](./src/assets/img/helmet.jpg) like the following

- Run `make predict-video` to run a demo of the YOLOv5 model on a video, which will make prediction on the [video.mp4](./src/assets/video/video.mp4) like the following

- Run `make camera-detect` to run a demo of the YOLOv5 model on webcam, which will make prediction in real-time

### Useful Commands
- `make train` to train a custom YOLO model based on dataset 3
- `make clean` to clean the project setup, including the Python virtual environment and the runs folder generated by YOLO
